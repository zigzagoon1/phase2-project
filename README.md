# Flatiron School Phase 2 React Project

## Usage
Welcome to my project! For it, I created a small memory game, with a page for you to leave comments as well as a High Scores
page to see where you rank against others. You start off on the Home tab, and can use the navigation links at the top of every page to switch between the different parts of the single-page application. 

### Images
Images for the memory card game were all taken from www.pixabay.com, which offers free-to-use, royalty-free images for projects.
